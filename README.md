How to install (will upate with coding standards and more details later):

If using windows or doing android dev:  
-pull repo/branch  
-open cmd  
-cd into directory  
-run command npm install  
-open android emulator from android studio  
-run command react-native run-android  

If using Mac or doing ios dev:  
-pull repo/branch  
-open terminal  
-cd into directory  
-run command npm install  
-run command react-native run-ios  

If that doesn't work and you dont have cocoa pods then go install it using instructions on site then
-cd into ios folder then run command pods install  
-cd .. back to root and then run command react-native run-ios
